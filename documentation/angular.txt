Structure:
  Main angular file is public/js/wm.js.
  This contains the main warmains angular app along with the config for all
  states.
  All controllers are in public/js/controllers, and directives alike.
  These js files are minified and combined into 1 controller/directive js file.

States:
  The main index.jade file contains routing all the different states.
  States are stored in public/states as html files.

Create new states:

  1. Create the state in wm.js config.
  2. Create the html state partial in /public/states.
  3. Create the controller (if needed) in /public/js/controllers.
  4. BEFORE GULP: will need to include the controller in index / footer
